##Forker's Plans
I have simple plans to personalize this fork:
1) Join the RR listing with the Rank, for example "Platinum 2 - 15RR" or "Silver 3 - 89RR" 
2) Allow for 2 or 3 weapon skins to be shown at any given moment, but probably done at the cost of removing customizability.
##UPDATE (20/2/2023):
I have now completed both objectives without removing customizability, now just to finetune it.
My new goals are:
3) Change "Skin 1" and "Skin 2" in the title row of the table to their respective configuration
4) Cut out unnecessary excess lines
I'm thinking #3 is going to be more difficult since my greatest feat in Python is print("hello world")
