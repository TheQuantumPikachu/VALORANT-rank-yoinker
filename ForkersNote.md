#Forker's Plans
I have simple plans to personalize this fork:
1: Join the RR listing with the Rank, for example "Platinum 2 - 15RR" or "Silver 3 - 89RR" 
2: Allow for 2 or 3 weapon skins to be shown at any given moment, but probably done at the cost of removing customizability.  
  
#UPDATE (20/2/2023):  
  
I have now completed both objectives without removing customizability, now just to finetune it.  
My new goals are:  
3: Change "Skin 1" and "Skin 2" in the title row of the table to their respective configuration  
4: Cut out unnecessary excess lines  
I'm thinking #3 is going to be more difficult since my greatest feat in Python is print("hello world")

#UPDATE (4/4/2023):

#3 was completed! I'm happy with the results, let me know if there's a bug 
I'm gonna be terribly honest I have no clue what I was thinking when I added goal #4 haha 
Anyways, I don't know where to go with this project, I'm thinking I'll release a build over the weekend. Final exams are coming up so my concentration is diverted to academic work. 
I think I'll update the screenshots to fit my version of the project.
